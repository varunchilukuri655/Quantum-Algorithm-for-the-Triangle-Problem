# Introduction:

Triangle counting is a graph algorithm that is used to count the number of triangles in a given undirected graph. Triangles refer to a set of three vertices that are connected by edges. This algorithm is useful in many applications, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and network security.

# Implementation:

### The implementation of the triangle counting algorithm in classical computing involves five main steps.

The algorithm implemented here takes an input graph in the form of an adjacency matrix and checks for the presence of triangles. The algorithm starts by asking the user to input the number of vertices in the graph and whether the vertices are connected or not.

Next, the adjacency matrix of the graph is created using the user input. The algorithm then checks for the presence of triangles in the graph. This is done by computing the cube of the adjacency matrix and subtracting the diagonal elements of the resulting matrix.

The algorithm then checks each vertex for the presence of triangles and prints out the triangles for each vertex. Finally, the algorithm prints out the overall triangles in the graph along with the count of triangles in the graph.

# Observations:
### The interesting observations or insights that our team noticed while implementing the algorithm.

During the implementation of the algorithm, we observed that the matrix multiplication approach is more efficient than the brute force approach for triangle counting. The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of three vertices, which can be computationally expensive for large graphs. In contrast, the matrix multiplication approach involves computing the cube of the adjacency matrix, which is more efficient and scalable. 

We also noticed that the number of triangles in a graph can be used to determine the clustering coefficient, which is a measure of how closely the nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.

In conclusion, the triangle counting algorithm is a useful tool for graph analysis, and its implementation can be optimized using matrix multiplication.

# Efficiency:

### The time complexity of the code can be analyzed as follows:

Step 2: Creating the adjacency matrix takes O(n^2) time, as it involves iterating over each vertex pair and asking for input.

Step 3: Computing the matrix power A^2 takes O(n^3) time, as it involves iterating over each entry of the matrix and performing a dot product operation. Computing A^3 and the diagonal subtraction take O(n^3) time each as well, so the overall time complexity of this step is O(n^3).

Step 4: Extracting the triangles from the matrix product involves iterating over each entry of A3 and checking whether the corresponding vertex pairs form a triangle. This takes O(n^3) time in the worst case, as there can be n^3 possible vertex triplets to check.

Step 5: Printing the results takes O(n^2) time, as it involves iterating over each entry of the adjacency matrix and the list of triangles.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3).

As for space complexity, the code uses an n x n adjacency matrix and three additional n x n matrices, so the space complexity is O(n^2).

In terms of efficiency, the matrix multiplication method used here is generally more efficient than a brute force approach for counting triangles in a graph, which would involve iterating over all possible vertex triplets and checking whether they form triangles. However, for very small graphs, the difference in performance may not be significant.
