# Introduction:

Triangle counting is a graph algorithm that is used to count the number of triangles in a given undirected graph. Triangles refer to a set of three vertices that are connected by edges. This algorithm is useful in many applications, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, and network security.

# Implementation:

The implementation of the triangle counting algorithm involves five main steps.

1. The first step involves selecting a programming language for implementation. In this case, we have selected Python.

2. The second step involves converting the given graph to an adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. Each row and column represent a vertex, and the matrix element (i,j) represents an edge between vertex i and vertex j.

3. The third step involves using matrix multiplication to compute the cube of the adjacency matrix. The matrix product is computed as A^3 = A * A^2. The diagonal elements of the resulting matrix represent the number of triangles that include a given vertex.

4. The fourth step involves extracting the triangles from the matrix product. The algorithm checks for each vertex if a triangle exists or not by looking for a non-zero value in the corresponding position in the matrix.

5. Finally, the fifth step involves printing the overall triangles in the graph.

# Observations:
The interesting observations or insights that our team noticed while implementing the algorithm.

During the implementation of the algorithm, we observed that the matrix multiplication approach is more efficient than the brute force approach for triangle counting. The brute force approach involves checking all possible combinations of three vertices, which can be computationally expensive for large graphs. In contrast, the matrix multiplication approach involves computing the cube of the adjacency matrix, which is more efficient and scalable.

In conclusion, the triangle counting algorithm is a useful tool for graph analysis, and its implementation can be optimized using matrix multiplication.
