# Quantum-Algorithm-for-the-Triangle-Problem
The Triangle Problem is the task of identifying whether a given graph contains a triangle or not. The brute-force approach for this problem would require checking every possible triangle in the graph, which would take exponential time. Therefore, there is a need for a more efficient algorithm, which can provide a faster solution.

Here we do Classical Computing Implementation and Quantum Computing Implementation for the problem.
